-- CTE Common Table Expressions
-- A Common Table Expression (CTE) is the result set of a query 
-- which exists temporarily and for use only within the context of a larger query. 
-- Much like a derived table, the result of a CTE is not stored and exists only for the duration of the query


-- CTE advantages: code clearity, recursive, ...
